# Homeworks for Intro to Machine Learning Course

### [Homework 1](https://github.com/rayansami/CS595-intro-to-machine-learning/tree/master/Homework%201)

[gradient-descent](https://github.com/rayansami/CS595-intro-to-machine-learning/blob/master/Homework%201/gradient-descent.ipynb) : Simply a practice problem for gradient descent. Here I had to develop a dataset using numpy random. Then implemented functions fot cost and gradient. After that I assessed the convergence and observed different behaviour by changing step size and number of iterations

[multivarate linear regression](https://github.com/rayansami/CS595-intro-to-machine-learning/blob/master/Homework%201/multivariate-linear-regression.ipynb) : Solved a polynomial regression problem. Implemented cost function and gradient descent for this problem.

[linear-regression](https://github.com/rayansami/CS595-intro-to-machine-learning/blob/master/Homework%201/linear-regression.ipynb) : Had a chance to choose dataset and work on that independently. I choosed [bodybrainDataset](https://github.com/rayansami/CS595-intro-to-machine-learning/blob/master/Homework%201/bodybrainDataset.csv) and built a model to predict BodyWeight from BrainWeight.
